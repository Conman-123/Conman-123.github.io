				<h2>Part A</h2>
			</header>
			<section>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>The goal of Part A of this project was to produce a concept document that described the what, why and how of our website. We were also tasked to pitch our idea, and to create a poster as a visual aid for this pitch.</p>
				<h3>Idea Development</h3>
				<a class="img-link single-img" href="Images/first-sketch.png" title="The very first sketch I made for the original concept.">
					<img src="Images/first-sketch.png" alt="A coloured sketch of the original concept">
				</a>
				<!--<figcaption>Figure 1. The very first sketch I made for the original concept</figcaption>-->
				<p>The project began with our first brainstorming session, in which we focused on developing ideas of what we could do with the SLQ data available to us. My method for this was to limit my scope. Rather than looking at all the datasets at once, I chose one dataset at a time and tried to think of what I could do with it. </p><p>My final idea utilised the convict register dataset, and it was an interactive map with a timeline for the user to see how the convict population of Australian convict colonies changed over time. When we formed our group we developed this idea further, proposing additional features such as a ship game where the user must complete the journey to Australia, and a story where the user follows the life of a single convict.</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<p>From here I created the first proper concept sketches. These displayed the two main pages of the site we were planning: the introduction page and the Australia page. The introduction page was planned to introduce the reader to the site by having them follow the journey of the First Fleet, learning along the way. Once they reached Australia, they would be on the Australia page, which is where all of the main data would be utilised in the form of the timeline, the map, and the tabs with information on convicts, ships and milestones.</p>
				<h3>Poster</h3>
				<p>After we had developed our idea to this point, I began work on the poster for our pitch. Since the poster was only meant to serve as a companion piece in the pitch, I wanted to keep the design simple, with our three concept images front and centre and the additional information about the concept grouped together at the top.</p>

				<h3>Reflection on Part A</h3>
				<p>I think Part A was successful. Our group formed and developed a unique and interesting concept to utilise the SLQ data, we produced a concept document that matched the required criteria, and we pitched our concept to an audience. The only change I would have made would be to offload some more of the work to the others in the group, which (as I discuss in the <a href="#course-reflection">course reflection</a>) was an issue with my personality that I have been trying to overcome.</p>

					<h2>Part B</h2>
			</header>
			<section>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>During this phase of the project we created and tested with a paper prototype to gain feedback on our concept and our plan for the website. After this we began developing a digital prototype of our concept, and we also wrote a progress document that described the work we had completed by the end of Part B, any changes we had made to the concept along the way, and a plan for implementation and final delivery.</p>
				<h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
				<p>My role in developing the paper prototype was to create the testing plan we would use to guide the user through the prototype and to gather useful feedback. I worked with the group member who was creating the actual prototype so that I knew what they could create, and they knew what I wanted them to create so the users could test the important interactions of the site.</p>
				<a class="img-link single-img" href="Images/paper-prototyping.jpg" title="A user interacting with our paper prototype.">
					<img src="Images/paper-prototyping.jpg" alt="A user interacting with our paper prototype">
				</a>
				<h3>Digital Prototype</h3>
				<p>We had two developers in our group and we split most of the work on the website. Our group had decided that our minimum viable product (MVP) for the prototype would be to get the Australia page mostly functionally complete. This included the map of Australia with each location we would be using, the convict and ship tabs for some supplemental information, and the timeline that would change the size of the location dots on the map with convict data from SLQ as well as triggering events at each stage in the timeline.</p>
				<p>The first thing I created was the base HTML and CSS for the page. This began with the map of Australia itself. To implement this, I decided to use an SVG so the map would not lose quality on larger screens, and I used some CSS positioning tricks to keep the location dots in the right place on the map regardless of screen size or shape. I then added the buttons on the right-hand side and a placeholder for the timeline on the left, as well as implementing the basic popup functionality for the buttons and the locations.</p>
				<a class="img-link single-img" href="Images/part-b-demo-first-version.png" title="A screenshot of the very first version of the site.">
					<img src="Images/part-b-demo-first-version.png" alt="A screenshot of the very first version of the site">
				</a>
				<p>Me and the other developer then worked together to choose and implement a jQuery plugin for the timeline. Unfortunately, issues with the plugin caused us to spend a lot of time troubleshooting, so I was not able to integrate the SLQ data with the timeline. Instead I used temporary sizes to simulate the intended functionality for the demo.</p>

				<h3>Feedback</h3>
				<p>The feedback we received in Part B came from the paper prototyping exercise and the progress demo of our digital prototype. The paper prototype received mostly positive feedback, with one suggestion to increase interactivity, and our own observation that the icons on our buttons were not clear enough. This second issue was easily resolved by adding labels to the buttons, but since the first issue was only brought up by one tester it was put on hold until we received the feedback from the progress demo. This demo feedback was extremely significant in that it confirmed the need for more interactivity and would ultimately transform our concept.</p>
				<h3>Reflection on Part B</h3>
				<p>Part B was only a partial success for me. While we did perform a successful paper prototyping exercise and created a good progress document, I don’t feel that our digital prototype was complete enough. This was mainly due to the issues with the timeline, so if I was to change my approach to this part of the project, I would try and start working on the prototype earlier and I would assign more of the less complex development work to some of the designers to give me and the other developer more time to fix the issues and implement the intended functionality.</p>

			<header class="section-header" id="part-c">
				<h2>Part C</h2>
			</header>
			<section>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>Part C was the final stretch of this whole project. In these few weeks we would finish the website, pitch it at a trade show, and write a final delivery report that describes and reflects on the final concept and the overall outcomes of the project.</p>
				<h3>Changes to Concept</h3>
				<p>Taking in the feedback from Part B, the group got together and brainstormed some ideas. We decided to scrap the introduction page because we realised that it was not actually very interactive, and we resolved to implement a choose-your-own-adventure style game to guide the user through time. The user would interact with the main character and make choices that affect the character’s life and the situations they end up in. Rather than reading a paragraph about an event that happened in this historical period, the user would experience the event through the character. This new idea would not only increase the interactivity, it would also instigate learning in a more fun and humanised way that would appeal to our target audience of roughly middle-school aged children.</p>
				<h3>Timeline</h3>
				<p>My first priority was implementing the timeline to use actual data from the SLQ. There were two main challenges with this task, the first of which was dealing with the extremely large dataset. At over 80MB and 123’000 rows, downloading the entire dataset and processing it all on the client side was unreasonable to say the least. My solution to this problem was to use SQL queries in the AJAX calls that get the SLQ API to do all the hard processing work before returning just a few rows that say the number of convicts that arrived at each location. This minimises both the computing power and the bandwidth that the website uses, therefore improving the user experience.</p>
				<a class="img-link single-img" href="Images/example-ajax-data.png" title="An example of some of the data returned by the AJAX calls to the SQL API.">
					<img src="Images/example-ajax-data.png" alt="An example of some of the data returned by the AJAX calls to the SQL API">
				</a>
				<p>The second challenge was to get the correct locations out of this returned data. As you can see in the above image, the location names weren’t in any standard format. For example, Van Diemen’s Land was found in the dataset as “Van Diemen’s Land”, “van diemens land”, “v.d.e” and so on. To overcome this, I utilised regular expressions to search for key terms in the data. Not only did this prevent me from having to do a lot of manual sorting, it also allows the system to continue to work if the dataset is ever changed or added to.</p>
				<h3>Character Interactions</h3>
				<p>When making the character interaction I began by making the basic shell (see video below) that would serve as the template that we could simply change the content of as the story progressed. This was just achieved using some basic HTML and CSS, with some transitions to add some liveliness and some jQuery to implement the showing and hiding. Then began the big job of implementing the choose-your-own-adventure style functionality.</p>
				<!-- <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gmb0rlqAHNU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> -->
				<video width="800px" controls autoplay muted loop>
					<source src="Video/DECO1800 Character Clip.mp4" type="video/mp4">
				</video>
				<p>Each interaction with the character (the character’s dialogue and the options that the user could choose from) was added into the HTML, which was not the cleanest way to do it was the best option with the time we had. I then created a class in the JavaScript file to keep track of the user’s decisions and handle the processing of which part of the story to show next, so each time the user pressed a button representing a choice, the ID of that button was passed to the class and the relevant part of the story was shown to the user. I then integrated this system with the new timeline system that the other developer created, so that when the user went to the next level the character would automatically pop up and tell the user about an event that was happening to them.</p>
				<h3>Final Aesthetics</h3>
				<p>The visual aesthetics of the site had always been a temporary placeholder that we planned to change only once we were closer to the end of the project. The layout was kept roughly the same, but the final colour scheme was implemented by one of the designers. Just before the end of the project, after everything else was done, I went though and added the final touches: getting the font sizes scaling correctly, adding some images to the location popups, and adding some small additional useability features like ‘close’ buttons on some of the popups (to complement the usual cross in the top right corner that was originally the only way to close the popups) and a popup to allow the user to easily restart the story once they reached the end.</p>

					<h3>Reflection on Part C</h3>
					<p>I am very pleased with the results of Part C. We implemented all of the planned functionality of the website, and I love the final visual aesthetic. The final concept is much more interactive and engaging than our original concept, but unfortunately the format was not very good for the trade show. With so many demos to try, people didn’t want to spend the time reading the character’s dialogue, so most skipped over it and missed out on the most significant part of the website. However, those who did read all of the dialogue said they thoroughly enjoyed the interactions and the decisions they had to make.</p>

				<h3>Ideation and Planning</h3>
				<p>Since I have never made a portfolio website before, I began by researching the topic and gathering together a page of notes outlining the key points I should focus on. I then started sketching out some ideas for the layout of the page and some of the navigation options. While doing this I kept in my mind how these elements would respond to different screen sizes. A fully responsive website is also something I have never tackled before, and this relatively simple site seemed like an ideal place to start mastering the subject.</p>
				<a class="img-link single-img tall-img" href="Images/planning-sketches.jpg" title="A page in my notebook where I sketched some ideas for the website.">
					<img src="Images/planning-sketches.jpg" alt="A page in my notebook where I sketched some ideas for the website">
				</a>
				<h3>Execution</h3>
				<p>The layout and presentation of the portfolio content is probably the most important part of a portfolio website, so I began with this. I created the HTML and added some real content so I could see what I was styling, then I began adding CSS to layout the content in an easily readable, mobile-friendly way. Throughout the development process I was constantly checking how the website appeared on my phone, as well as in different sizes and shapes of the browser window on my PC and in different web browsers.</p>

				<div class="img-gallery">
					<div>
						<a class="img-link img-noshadow" href="Images/responsive-full.png" title="A screenshot of the portfolio website at desktop scale.">

							<img src="Images/responsive-mobile-wide-shadow.png" alt="A screenshot of the portfolio website at mobile scale">
						</a>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>I chose two plugins for an image lightbox and an image carousel to increase useability and to be able to show multiple images while keeping the layout clean and uncluttered. I chose the plugins based on their visual style and aesthetics, their browser support, and their responsiveness.</p>
				<p>I designed the section headers to provide clear distinctions between each section, while also adding colour, texture and contrast. Then I started designing the site header, which utilises a gradient background clipped to the text to provide a colourful, eye-catching title. The page navigation links to each section, and there is a ‘back-to-top’ button always fixed in the bottom right corner of the page to quickly return the user to the top of the page.</p>
				<h3>Reflection on Portfolio</h3>
				<p>Overall, I think the portfolio was a success. I am very happy with the final site and I learned some new things while making it. I think the content is easily readable while the site portrays my style as a designer. The only thing I would consider changing is to make the navigation move down the page with you as you scroll (as a sidebar on desktop and possibly a context menu on tablet and mobile). The reason I did not attempt this was simply a lack time, but if I could add this feature I think it would improve the site’s navigability.</p>

				<h2>Course Reflection</h2>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p>Looking back at my first journal post, I had two main goals for this course: to continue to develop my technical knowledge, and to improve my design and group work skills. I have definitely accomplished the first goal this semester. Throughout the entire course I continued to work with—and add to—my existing knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery as I worked on the workshop exercises, our group’s website, and my portfolio. I also got to learn about working with APIs and populating webpages dynamically using jQuery, and then with PHP.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, I did not get much opportunity to develop my design skills since I was mainly a developer in the group. Although I did help make some design decisions, especially in Part A and Part C, there was not much opportunity for increasing my design knowledge. However, there are other courses I can take to delve deeper into this area in the future.</p>
				<p>I also feel like I did not improve as much as I would have liked in my group-work skills. Reflecting on the decisions I made as group leader this semester, I can see that my delegation of responsibilities was not quite equal—I failed to put as much trust in my group members as I should have. This was the main concern I had coming into this course, and it turned out this concern was prescient. However, I now know to really focus on this in any future group-work I do.</p>
				<p>Even though I only achieved one of my personal goals, I quite enjoyed this course. I love the concept of being free to create what we want, and it was interesting to see all the different directions everyone took with their ideas. The main gripe I have with the course is the documentation. I felt that we wasted so much time writing reports that it limited the time we had to actually design and create the final product. I understand that reports are important, but I really think that reducing the quantity would really make this course much more beneficial by allowing us more time to develop our skills while still helping us practice and improve our report writing.</p>
				<p>Thank you to everyone involved in this course, I had a great time!</p>
